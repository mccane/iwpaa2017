# iwpaa2017
Some files for my iwpaa talk.

The .ipynb files are jupyter notebook files. The .py files are standard python files derived from the notebook.

There are a couple of ways to use these files during the talk:
- if you just want to look at any of the slides, open the ipynb files in github. 
- if you have jupyter installed, then you can download the files and start up jupyter to view and play them using something like the following command:

    jupyter-notebook svm_intro.ipynb

- if you don't have jupyter installed, then you can download the .py files and run them directly with python or through your favorite python environment:

    python svm_intro1.py
